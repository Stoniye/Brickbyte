# Brickbyte

A free and open-source voxel-based survival game (a.k.a. Minecraft clone), for Windows and Linux. It would also be compatible with Android, iOS and macOS, but there is no official support.

### Features

I'm just at the beginning of the project, there aren't enough features to list here yet :)
