A **free** and **open-source voxel-based survival game** (Minecraft like), for **Windows** and **Linux**. It would also be compatible with Android, iOS and macOS, but there is no official support (yet?).

### Features

I'm just at the beginning of the project, there aren't enough features to list here yet :)

### Vision

I love Minecraft, but over time I’ve felt that its core experience is intentionally very grounded and traditional. It focuses heavily on simplicity and realism, which is part of its charm, but it also leaves me wanting more depth and fantasy.

I miss having a wider variety of ores with unique properties, more advanced abilities tied to materials, deeper magic systems, and a richer ecosystem of mobs and bosses that feel truly distinct and challenging.

**Brickbyte** aims to build on the familiar foundation of Minecraft’s voxel-based gameplay while expanding it with more creative, fantastical, and experimental ideas. The goal is to keep the intuitive core systems players know and love, but surround them with a new and unique character, more “fancy” mechanics, enhanced progression, magical elements, unique materials, and more dynamic encounters.
